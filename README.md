# Webmaker Badges beta testing FAQ

Webmaker badges (beta) is live on [https://webmaker.mofostaging.net](https://webmaker.mofostaging.net)! Here's everything you need to know to help us beta test.

## What badges are available?

Currently, there are two badges live on [webmaker.mofostaging.net](https://webmaker.mofostaging.net):

1. [Webmaker Super Mentor] badge (https://webmaker.mofostaging.net/badges/webmaker-super-mentor
): This badge is for mentors who have gone above and beyond in contributing to the Webmaker project. [[[[[Super Mentors currently have the ability to issue the **Hive Community Member** badge.]]]] Later this summer, Super Mentors will have the ability to issue Webmaker Mentor badges and Web Literacy badges.

2. [Hive Community Member] badge (https://webmaker.mofostaging.net/badges/hive-community-member
): This badge is for active Hive Network members that have demonstrated abilities in Peer Observation, Resource Sharing, and Process Documentation.

## What is 'staging'?

'Staging' is like a sandbox. It's ([webmaker.mofostaging.net](https://webmaker.mofostaging.net)) our test server for webmaker.org. That means any badges you earn or issue **won't be connected to your real Webmaker account**. You won't be earning the badges for real -- you'll just be helping us test out the process.

## Where do my badges show up?

On your [Webmaker profile page. (staging)](https://webmaker.mofostaging.net/user/#!/[username]/badges) You can find your profile page at a URL like this one: https://webmaker.mofostaging.net/user/#!/[username]/badges.

For example, this is [k88hudson's profile page](https://webmaker.mofostaging.net/user/#!/k88hudson/badges).

## How do I apply for badges?

Click the `Apply` button on either of these pages:

* [Hive Community Member](https://webmaker.mofostaging.net/badges/hive-community-member)

* [Webmaker Super Mentor](https://webmaker.mofostaging.net/badges/webmaker-super-mentor)

## How do I issue badges?

You must be an administrator or have a Webmaker Super Mentor badge.

To issue the [Hive Community Member](https://webmaker.mofostaging.net/badges/hive-community-member
), make sure you are signed in to Persona. Click the "Issue badge" button on that page.


## How do I approve badge applications?

You must have a Webmaker Super Mentor badge or be an administrator to approve badge applications. Here's how to do it:

1) Sign into [Badgekit](https://badgekit.mofostaging.net) with Persona. Click on the "Applications" tab. 
(If you don't see this tab or any badge applications, contact @k88hudson or @echristensen on IRC to add you to the admin group.)

## I'm a Webmaker or Hive administrator. What else can I do to help test?

First, make sure you have a Webmaker admin account on mofostaging. There should be a little admin badge next to your username in the top right corner of the staging site. If there isn't, ask @k88hudson, @cade or @jbuck in #webmaker on IRC to make you an admin.

![admin badge](https://k88hudson-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/screen-shots/k88mac@2x_2014-05-20_at_5.34.50_PM.png)

Go to [https://webmaker.mofostaging.net/admin/badges](webmaker.mofostaging.org/admin/badges) to see a list of badges.
